# landing-page
This project is a basic template for a websites landing page. It primarily uses css element flexbox to align and position the different div elements.
One of the main challenges I had to overcome was getting the positioning to be straight on the header portion. I had to play with the padding and margin
quite extensively to get it to line up right as well as play with the image size. A new css element I learned during ths project was the border radius element
which was required to create rounded corners on the images in the random info section.
